**Angelo Antonio Prisco** - [AngeloAntonioPrisco](https://github.com/AngeloAntonioPrisco)  

At the moment, I am the only contributor to this project.  
I am a student at **University of Salerno (UNISA)**, currently enrolled in the Master's program in **Software Engineering**.

## ðŸ“Œ What is it?

**Dddit Server** is a **Java Spring** project designed to provide *versioning services* for **3D resources**.  
Currently, it supports:

- **FBX models** versioning
- **Materials** versioning, understood as sets of PNG textures  

Main features include:
- Creating and managing **repositories**  
- Handling **resources**, **branches**, and **versions**  
- Each version includes **author**, **comment** and additional metadata  
- A **repository invitations system** to enable collaboration among multiple users on the same repo

## ðŸš€ How to try it

The server is intended to run on an **Azure VM**, but it can also be executed locally using **IntelliJ IDEA**.

### Run locally
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AngeloAntonioPrisco/ddditserver.git
   ```

2. Open the project in IntelliJ.

3. Edit the Run/Debug configuration to load environment variables from a custom *.env* file, like:
    ```bash
    GREMLIN_USERNAME="gremlin-username"
    GREMLIN_KEY="gremlin-key"

    COSMOS_SQL_ENDPOINT="cosmos-sql-endpoint"
    COSMOS_SQL_KEY="cosmos-sql-key"
    COSMOS_SQL_DATABASE="cosmos-sql-database"
    COSMOS_SQL_CONTAINER_VERSIONS="cosmos-sql-container-versions"
    COSMOS_SQL_CONTAINER_TOKEN_BLACKLIST="cosmos-sql-token-blacklist"

    BLOB_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="blob-storage-connection-string"
    BLOB_STORAGE_CONTAINER_MESHES="blob-storage-container-meshes"
    BLOB_STORAGE_CONTAINER_MATERIALS="blob-storage-container-materials"

    JWT_SECRET="jwt-secret"

    MODELS_FOLDER_PATH="models-folder-path"
    FROM_EMAIL="from-email"
    TO_EMAIL="to-email"
    APP_PASSWORD="app-password"
    ```
4. Start the application from IntelliJ.

**Notes**: At the moment, one of the classes in the project, **CosmosVersionRepositoryImpl**, contains a `saveVersion` method that builds an ad-hoc Cosmos DB URL pointing to the developerâ€™s personal Azure account.  
If you want to use your own Azure setup, you should update this return operation so that it conforms to your Azure account configuration.
